## 🔑 Key System Functions

The system operates with well-defined focuses to ensure control and security:

* **Validation and Granting:** The system performs a dual check:
    * It **Authenticates** the user's identity (proves who they are).
    * It **Authorizes** the level of access they will have to resources.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Allows the definition of access privileges based on the **role or position** the individual holds. This simplifies administration, as permissions are inherited by the functional group.
* **Unified Credential Management:** Facilitates the use of a **single digital identity** for access to multiple internal and external systems (known as identity federation).
* **Software Access Control:** Specifically monitors and manages the permissions that users have within the various applications used by the organization.
